Consider implementing password expiration policies, but balance security with usability. Monitor for password-related security incidents and educate users about password sec...

150. Multi-layered password security includes technical controls and user education. Implement password strength meters to guide users in creating strong passwords. Use password breach checking to prevent reuse of compromised passwords. Consider implementing passwordless authentication methods like biometrics or hardware tokens where appropriate. Regular security awareness training helps users understand the importance of strong passwords and how to create them effectively. Regular audits and assessm...

151. Strong passwords are the first line of defense against unauthorized access. A strong password should be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using personal information, common words, or patterns that can be easily guessed. Consider using a password manager to generate and store unique passwords for each account. Regularly update passwords, especially for sensitive accounts. Never share passwords with others ...
